    "## PROBLEM 1: Minimum overlap lengths and read spectra (1 POINT)\n",
    "Recall that the de Bruijn approach to genome assembly with shotgun sequencing reads is to approximate the $k$-mer spectrum of the genome by the union of the $k$-mer spectra of the reads and then to use an Eulerian path approach to computing the assembly.  In the absence of sequencing errors, this approach may be successful if the read spectrum is equal to the genome spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the fragment assembly approach for the same shotgun sequencing data is to find overlaps between pairs of reads and then to compute a superstring (ideally the shortest such superstring).  In practice, one typically only considers overlaps between pairs of reads that are at least of some minimum length, `min_length`.  Thus, in the absence of sequencing errors, this approach may be successful if the reads cover every position of the genome *and* and each pair of adjacent reads (in terms of their position along the genome) overlaps by at least `min_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will explore the relationship between the `min_length` parameter for fragment assembly and the value of $k$ for the de Bruijn approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a set of error-free shotgun sequencing reads satisfies the requirements for fragment assembly to be successful with a minimum overlap length of `min_length` and that all reads are longer than twice the value of `min_length`.  As a function of `min_length`, what is the largest value of $k$ such that we are guaranteed that the read spectrum is equal to the genome spectrum (such that the de Bruijn approach may be successful)?\n",
